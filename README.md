## Install / Flash Firmware

### ESP32 boards (Heltec V3, T-Beam, T-Beam 1W, T3, LoRanger V1)

Two release assets are published per ESP32 board:

| File | When to use | Tool required |
|---|---|---|
| `<board>_firmware.bin` | **Normal OTA update** — device already running, WiFi reachable | None — upload via device web UI at `192.168.4.1 → Device → Update Firmware` |
| `<board>_web_factory.bin` | **First-time flash or recovery** — new device, bricked device, or partition table changed | USB cable + Chrome/Edge → [kj7nye.github.io/LoRa\_FieldOps\_APRS\_Tracker/flasher](https://kj7nye.github.io/LoRa_FieldOps_APRS_Tracker/flasher/) |

> **Why two files?** The factory binary is a merged image (bootloader + partition table + firmware + filesystem) that writes the entire flash from scratch. The OTA binary is the bare application only — it fits in the OTA partition and is what the device web UI expects. Uploading the factory binary via OTA will fail with "Not Enough Space."

> **When you must use the factory binary (USB required):** first flash on a new device; recovery after a bad flash; any time the partition table changes (e.g. upgrading from a pre-OTA firmware release to one with OTA support).

### Heltec T114 (nRF52840)

| Method | Steps | Download |
|---|---|---|
| **BLE OTA** | Type `otadfu` in serial CLI → open [nRF Connect](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-mobile) (iOS/Android) → scan → connect to DFU target → DFU tab → select zip | [`heltec_t114_dfu.zip`](https://github.com/KJ7NYE/LoRa_FieldOps_APRS_Tracker/releases/latest) |
| **USB drag-and-drop** | Double-tap RESET → drag `.uf2` onto the USB drive that appears | [`heltec_t114_firmware.uf2`](https://github.com/KJ7NYE/LoRa_FieldOps_APRS_Tracker/releases/latest) |

## Roles

Each device can be configured as one of three roles at runtime — no reflash needed:

| Role | Function |
|---|---|
| **Tracker** | Beacons position via LoRa RF using SmartBeacon adaptive rate |
| **iGate** | Receives LoRa RF packets and uploads to APRS-IS over WiFi |
| **Digipeater** | Receives and re-transmits LoRa RF packets following standard APRS path rules |

Any role can also digipeat simultaneously. The digipeater includes a 30-second hash deduplication buffer to suppress repeated copies of the same packet.

---

## Features

### APRS / RF
- **SmartBeacon** — adaptive beaconing rate based on speed and heading change; parked tracker falls back to slow-rate beacons automatically (no separate timer needed)
- **Mic-E encoding** — compact position format
- **Status beacons** — configurable status text, triggered by long button press (>3 s)
- **WIDE1-1 / WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1** path selection
- **Digipeater deduplication** — 25-slot djb2 hash ring, 30 s TTL prevents duplicate relays
- **6-character Maidenhead grid square** — displayed on TFT (format: `AA00aa`)
- **APRS station capability queries** — responds to directed and undirected queries from any APRS tool; see [APRS Station Queries](#aprs-station-queries)
- **PHG (Power-Height-Gain) beaconing** — optional uncompressed position beacon advertising fixed-station RF capability, sent on its own timer

### Connectivity
- **USB serial KISS TNC** — default mode at 115200 baud; compatible with APRSDroid, Xastir, Direwolf
- **BLE KISS TNC** — APRS.fi GATT service UUID; compatible with APRSDroid (Android), APRS.fi (iOS)
- **TCP KISS server** — starts automatically when WiFi STA is connected (configurable port, default 8001)
- **APRS-IS upload** — iGate role; passcode auto-computed from callsign (Friedman algorithm), optional override
- **Bluetooth Classic SPP** — ESP32 boards with HAS_BT_CLASSIC

### Serial interface
USB serial operates in three modes, switchable at runtime without reconnecting:
- **KISS mode** (default) — binary APRS passthrough for TNC clients
- **Setup mode** — interactive CLI for all configuration
- **Log mode** — live firmware log output at configurable verbosity

Type `setup` or `log` over serial to switch; any mode returns to KISS on disconnect or reboot.

### Configuration
- **Web UI** — served over WiFi AP (hold USR button ≥8 s while running, or callsign = NOCALL-7 on first boot); full configuration via browser, plus OTA firmware update, JSON config backup/restore, and a live firmware log viewer
- **Serial config tool** (`serial_config.html`) — standalone HTML page using the Web Serial API; works in Chrome/Edge 89+; no server required
- **Serial CLI** — `setup` → interactive command line with `help`, `show`, `save`, `reboot`; see [Serial CLI Reference](#serial-cli-reference) below and [SERIAL_SETUP.md](SERIAL_SETUP.md) for the full command set
- **JSON config file** — `tracker_conf.json` on LittleFS/SPIFFS; importable/exportable via serial config tool or the serial CLI's `export`/`import` commands

### Display
- **TFT (T114)** — 240×135 ST7789; tactical or callsign large header, 5 body lines, TX overlay, eco mode backlight timeout
- **OLED (V3/T-Beam/T3)** — 128×64; callsign header, role+battery, last-heard station
- **Tactical callsign** — when set, shown as the large primary identifier; RF callsign shown smaller below
- **"Last:" heard-station line** — shows the most recently heard station's callsign-SSID, or the reported object's name instead when the packet is an APRS Object Report
- **"Msg:" received-message indicator** — flashes on the T114's bottom row for any addressed or broadcast message (a query like `?PING?` or a plain free-text message); persists until the next received packet updates the heard-station line
- **Display eco mode** — configurable timeout; wakes on button press, packet RX, or TX
- **LED indicator** — heartbeat (50 ms/1.5 s) + TX/RX flash; can be disabled in config

### Button (USR)
- **Short press (50 ms – 3 s)** — send position beacon immediately
- **Long press (3 s – 8 s)** — send status beacon
- **Extra-long hold (≥8 s, while running)** — enter AP config mode (WiFi boards)

> **Note for Heltec V3 and LoRanger V1:** the USR button is wired to GPIO0 (the ESP32 BOOT pin). Holding it during power-up or reset forces the chip into ROM download mode instead of running firmware. AP mode must therefore be triggered at runtime, not at boot.

### Thermal Management (T-Beam 1W)

The T-Beam 1W has a cooling fan (GPIO41) and an NTC thermistor input (GPIO14). The firmware implements hybrid thermal control:

| Condition | Fan behaviour |
|---|---|
| LoRa TX active | Fan turns on immediately at TX start |
| Within 30 s of TX end | Fan held on (post-TX cooldown) |
| Temperature ≥ 50 °C | Fan turns on |
| Temperature < 42 °C and no TX cooldown | Fan turns off |
| Temperature ≥ 75 °C | Fan on + `!OVERTEMP` appended to next beacon |
| Temperature ≥ 85 °C | Clean shutdown (same path as low-battery shutdown) |

Temperature is sampled every 30 seconds from a Murata NCP18XH103F03RB (10 kΩ NTC, B = 3380 K) via a 10 kΩ pull-down voltage divider, using the ESP32-S3's eFuse-calibrated `analogReadMilliVolts()`.

- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) (VS Code extension or CLI)
- Python 3.x (for build scripts)

### Quick start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KJ7NYE/LoRa_FieldOps_APRS_Tracker
cd LoRa_FieldOps_APRS_Tracker

# Build all supported targets
pio run

# Build a specific target
pio run -e heltec_t114

# Flash + upload filesystem
pio run -e heltec_t114 -t upload
pio run -e heltec_t114 -t uploadfs
```

### Environments

| Environment | Board |
|---|---|
| `heltec_t114` | Heltec T114 (nRF52840) |
| `heltec_v3_433_aprs` | Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3 |
| `tbeam_433_aprs` | LilyGo T-Beam |

---

## First-Time Setup

1. Flash firmware and filesystem (`upload` + `uploadfs`)
2. On first boot, callsign defaults to `NOCALL-7` → device starts in AP mode
3. Connect to the `LoRaAPRS` WiFi network (password: `1234567890`)
4. Open `http://192.168.4.1` in a browser
5. Set your callsign, role, frequency, and path; click **Save**
6. Device reboots into normal operation

Alternatively, use the serial config tool:
1. Open `serial_config.html` in Chrome or Edge
2. Click **Select Port** and choose your device's USB serial port
3. The tool auto-enters Setup mode and reads the current config
4. Edit fields; each change is sent immediately
5. Click **Save** to persist, or **Reboot** to apply

---

## Serial Modes

The USB serial port operates in three mutually exclusive modes:

```
KISS mode (default)  →  type "setup"  →  Setup mode
                     →  type "log"    →  Log mode
Setup / Log mode     →  type "exit"   →  KISS mode (also on disconnect/reboot)
```

**KISS mode** — binary APRS TNC passthrough. Compatible with APRSDroid (USB TNC), Xastir, Direwolf, and other KISS TNC clients.

**Setup mode** — interactive CLI. All changes take effect immediately; `save` persists to flash.

**Log mode** — real-time firmware log. Verbosity controlled with `log <level>`. Does not interfere with BLE KISS TNC operation.

---

## BLE KISS TNC

The BLE KISS TNC uses the [APRS.fi GATT service](https://aprs.fi/info/a/APRSDROID) profile:

| | UUID |
|---|---|
| Service | `00000001-ba2a-46c9-ae49-01b0961f68bb` |
| TX (device → phone, notify) | `00000003-ba2a-46c9-ae49-01b0961f68bb` |
| RX (phone → device, write) | `00000002-ba2a-46c9-ae49-01b0961f68bb` |

**Compatible apps:** APRSDroid (Android), APRS.fi (iOS)

BLE KISS and USB serial log monitoring are fully independent — you can run both simultaneously. BLE KISS is unaffected by which serial mode is active.

---

## APRS-IS Passcode

The APRS-IS passcode is automatically computed from your callsign using the standard Friedman algorithm. You do not need to enter it manually.

To use a different passcode (e.g., for club callsigns where your personal call generates the valid passcode), enter it in the **Passcode (override)** field. Leave blank to use auto-computation.

---

## SmartBeacon Behaviour

SmartBeacon adjusts the beacon interval dynamically:
- **Moving fast** → short interval (fastRate)
- **Moving slow** → long interval (slowRate)
- **Stopped** (speed < 1 km/h) → beacons at slowRate regardless of distance; prevents the tracker from going silent when parked

Heading changes above `turnMinDeg` threshold trigger an immediate beacon regardless of time elapsed.

### Built-in profiles

Four fixed presets are built in, selected via `beacon smartset <0..3>`:

| Profile | Slow Rate | Slow Speed | Fast Rate | Fast Speed | Min Turn Angle | Turn Slope |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0 — Runner** | 90 s | 5 km/h | 45 s | 18 km/h | 12° | 60 |
| **1 — Bike** | 120 s | 5 km/h | 45 s | 50 km/h | 12° | 60 |
| **2 — Car** | 90 s | 10 km/h | 36 s | 97 km/h | 10° | 80 |
| **3 — Jetboat** | 60 s | 30 km/h | 10 s | 97 km/h | 5° | 150 |

A 5th profile, **Custom** (`smartset 4`), is fully user-editable rather than a fixed preset — see [SERIAL_SETUP.md's SmartBeacon Custom Profile section](SERIAL_SETUP.md#smartbeacon-custom-profile) for its tuning commands. Its out-of-the-box defaults are bike-like (120 s / 5 km/h / 60 s / 40 km/h / 12° / 60).

---

## APRS Station Queries

All device roles (Tracker, iGate, Digipeater) respond to APRS station capability queries as defined in APRS 1.01 §13. Queries are case-insensitive and may be sent from any APRS tool — APRSDroid, Xastir, APRS.fi, a handheld radio, etc.

Duplicate queries from the same station are suppressed for 60 seconds. If the incoming message includes a sequence number (`{NNN}`), an ACK is sent before the response.

Directed queries are also answered when addressed to the configured **tactical callsign** (object name), not just the device's real callsign — `?APRSP`/`?APRS?` addressed to the tactical name reply with the Object Report.

**Plain messages are ACKed too.** A free-text APRS message (not a query) addressed to the device's callsign or tactical name gets an ACK if it carries a sequence number — no automated reply, just the ack. The tracker sends this itself rather than relying on an attached KISS client, since it's commonly deployed with no client attached at all.

### Directed queries

Send as an APRS message addressed to the device's callsign (or its tactical callsign, if set):

| Query | Response |
|---|---|
| `?APRSD` | List of stations heard directly (no digi hop), space-separated |
| `?APRSH <CALL>` | Whether `<CALL>` has been heard recently and how long ago |
| `?APRSL` | All recently heard stations, newest first |
| `?APRSP` | Current position beacon (same as pressing the beacon button) |
| `?APRSS` | Current status text from config |
| `?APRST` or `?PING?` | Ping reply with device callsign |
| `?APRSV` or `?VER` | Firmware version string |

### Undirected queries

Send as an APRS message addressed to `APRS` or `IGATE`:

| Query | Addressee | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `?APRS?` | `APRS` | Position beacon from all listening stations |
| `?IGATE?` | `IGATE` | iGate-online confirmation *(iGate mode only)* |

### Anti-loop guard

Message packets addressed to the device's own callsign are never digipeated. This prevents IS→RF→IS loops when a query or response re-enters the network via the APRS-IS downlink.

---

## LoRanger V1 Notes

The LoRanger V1 uses a headless (no display) build. The `HAS_DISPLAY` flag is unset to avoid a boot hang that would otherwise occur when the I2C display initialisation fails.

The EBYTE E22-400M30S module is branded as SX1268 but ships with SX1262 silicon — the RadioLib SX1262 driver is used. Confirmed via `VERSION_STRING` readback during bring-up.

## What's different in this fork

This fork exists for two reasons: to support the [KJ7NYE LoRanger hardware](https://github.com/KJ7NYE/LoRanger),
and to make the firmware better suited for licensed-amateur tactical event support in the US.

- **LoRanger hardware support.** Firmware variant for an open-source ESP32-S3 + 1 W SX1268 + GPS tracker built
  for canyon and beyond-cellular field deployments. CC-BY-SA-4.0.

- **Defaults tuned for US compliance.** LoRa modulation defaults are set to comply with US licensed-amateur
  regulations on 70 cm. Operators outside the US should verify settings against their local rules before
  transmitting.

- **Tuned for dense multi-tracker channels.** Beacon cadence, comment-ID interval, SmartBeacon profile, and
  APRS path defaults are retuned for coordinated deployments where 15–20 trackers share a channel during an
  event window — search and rescue, ultra-marathon timing, jetboat racing, and similar.

- **Configuration ergonomics for field deployment.** USB serial setup CLI for scripted/tethered
  configuration, persistent digipeater state across reboots, and a short boot-time AP window that makes the
  web UI reachable without relying on display. Initial provisioning of a fresh device still routes through
  the web UI.

> Network compatibility note: every device on a LoRa APRS network must run identical SF/BW/CR. If you flash
> this fork onto a tracker that needs to talk to a fleet running stock CA2RXU defaults, you must either
> change the receivers or change this tracker's settings to match.

# Upstream Project — CA2RXU LoRa APRS Tracker/Station

This firmware is for using ESP32-based boards with LoRa modules and GPS to live in the APRS world.

> **NOTE:** To use Tx/Rx capabilities of this tracker you should also have a Tx/Rx
> [LoRa iGate](https://github.com/richonguzman/LoRa_APRS_iGate) nearby.
