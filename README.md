# LoRa Field Ops APRS Tracker

A multi-role LoRa APRS firmware for 433 MHz amateur radio operations. Supports tracker, iGate, and digipeater roles on a single configurable firmware build. Designed for field deployment at events, search and rescue operations, and remote area monitoring where cellular coverage is absent.

Derived from [richonguzman/LoRa_APRS_Tracker](https://github.com/richonguzman/LoRa_APRS_Tracker) (CA2RXU), with significant architectural changes and new features targeted at 433 MHz APRS operation.

## Roles

Each device can be configured as one of three roles at runtime — no reflash needed:

| Role | Function |
|---|---|
| **Tracker** | Beacons position via LoRa RF using SmartBeacon adaptive rate |
| **iGate** | Receives LoRa RF packets and uploads to APRS-IS over WiFi |
| **Digipeater** | Receives and re-transmits LoRa RF packets following standard APRS path rules |

Any role can also digipeat simultaneously. The digipeater includes a 30-second hash deduplication buffer to suppress repeated copies of the same packet.

---

## Features

### APRS / RF
- **SmartBeacon** — adaptive beaconing rate based on speed and heading change; parked tracker falls back to slow-rate beacons automatically (no separate timer needed)
- **Mic-E encoding** — compact position format
- **Status beacons** — configurable status text, triggered by long button press (>3 s)
- **WIDE1-1 / WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1** path selection
- **Digipeater deduplication** — 25-slot djb2 hash ring, 30 s TTL prevents duplicate relays
- **6-character Maidenhead grid square** — displayed on TFT (format: `AA00aa`)

### Connectivity
- **USB serial KISS TNC** — default mode at 115200 baud; compatible with APRSDroid, Xastir, Direwolf
- **BLE KISS TNC** — APRS.fi GATT service UUID; compatible with APRSDroid (Android), APRS.fi (iOS)
- **TCP KISS server** — starts automatically when WiFi STA is connected (configurable port, default 8001)
- **APRS-IS upload** — iGate role; passcode auto-computed from callsign (Friedman algorithm), optional override
- **Bluetooth Classic SPP** — ESP32 boards with HAS_BT_CLASSIC

### Serial interface
USB serial operates in three modes, switchable at runtime without reconnecting:
- **KISS mode** (default) — binary APRS passthrough for TNC clients
- **Setup mode** — interactive CLI for all configuration
- **Log mode** — live firmware log output at configurable verbosity

Type `setup` or `log` over serial to switch; any mode returns to KISS on disconnect or reboot.

### Configuration
- **Web UI** — served over WiFi AP (hold USR button at boot, or callsign = NOCALL-7); full configuration via browser
- **Serial config tool** (`serial_config.html`) — standalone HTML page using the Web Serial API; works in Chrome/Edge 89+; no server required
- **Serial CLI** — `setup` → interactive command line with `help`, `show`, `save`, `reboot`
- **JSON config file** — `tracker_conf.json` on LittleFS/SPIFFS; importable/exportable via serial config tool

### Display
- **TFT (T114)** — 240×135 ST7789; tactical or callsign large header, 5 body lines, TX overlay, eco mode backlight timeout
- **OLED (V3/T-Beam/T3)** — 128×64; callsign header, role+battery, last-heard station
- **Tactical callsign** — when set, shown as the large primary identifier; RF callsign shown smaller below
- **Display eco mode** — configurable timeout; wakes on button press, packet RX, or TX
- **LED indicator** — heartbeat (50 ms/1.5 s) + TX/RX flash; can be disabled in config

### Button (USR)
- **Short press (50 ms – 3 s)** — send position beacon immediately
- **Long press (≥3 s)** — send status beacon
- **Hold at boot** — force AP config mode (WiFi boards)

## Serial Modes

The USB serial port operates in three mutually exclusive modes:

```
KISS mode (default)  →  type "setup"  →  Setup mode
                     →  type "log"    →  Log mode
Setup / Log mode     →  type "exit"   →  KISS mode (also on disconnect/reboot)
```

**KISS mode** — binary APRS TNC passthrough. Compatible with APRSDroid (USB TNC), Xastir, Direwolf, and other KISS TNC clients.

**Setup mode** — interactive CLI. All changes take effect immediately; `save` persists to flash.

**Log mode** — real-time firmware log. Verbosity controlled with `log <level>`. Does not interfere with BLE KISS TNC operation.

---

## BLE KISS TNC

The BLE KISS TNC uses the [APRS.fi GATT service](https://aprs.fi/info/a/APRSDROID) profile:

| | UUID |
|---|---|
| Service | `00000001-ba2a-46c9-ae49-01b0961f68bb` |
| TX (device → phone, notify) | `00000003-ba2a-46c9-ae49-01b0961f68bb` |
| RX (phone → device, write) | `00000002-ba2a-46c9-ae49-01b0961f68bb` |

**Compatible apps:** APRSDroid (Android), APRS.fi (iOS)

BLE KISS and USB serial log monitoring are fully independent — you can run both simultaneously. BLE KISS is unaffected by which serial mode is active.

---

## APRS-IS Passcode

The APRS-IS passcode is automatically computed from your callsign using the standard Friedman algorithm. You do not need to enter it manually.

To use a different passcode (e.g., for club callsigns where your personal call generates the valid passcode), enter it in the **Passcode (override)** field. Leave blank to use auto-computation.

---

## SmartBeacon Behaviour

SmartBeacon adjusts the beacon interval dynamically:
- **Moving fast** → short interval (fastRate)
- **Moving slow** → long interval (slowRate)
- **Stopped** (speed < 1 km/h) → beacons at slowRate regardless of distance; prevents the tracker from going silent when parked

Heading changes above `turnMinDeg` threshold trigger an immediate beacon regardless of time elapsed.

---

## LoRanger V1 Notes

The LoRanger V1 uses a headless (no display) build. The `HAS_DISPLAY` flag is unset to avoid a boot hang that would otherwise occur when the I2C display initialisation fails.

The EBYTE E22-400M30S module is branded as SX1268 but ships with SX1262 silicon — the RadioLib SX1262 driver is used. Confirmed via `VERSION_STRING` readback during bring-up.

## What's different in this fork

This fork exists for two reasons: to support the [KJ7NYE LoRanger hardware](https://github.com/KJ7NYE/LoRanger),
and to make the firmware better suited for licensed-amateur tactical event support in the US.

- **LoRanger hardware support.** Firmware variant for an open-source ESP32-S3 + 1 W SX1268 + GPS tracker built
  for canyon and beyond-cellular field deployments. CC-BY-SA-4.0.

- **Defaults tuned for US compliance.** LoRa modulation defaults are set to comply with US licensed-amateur
  regulations on 70 cm. Operators outside the US should verify settings against their local rules before
  transmitting.

- **Tuned for dense multi-tracker channels.** Beacon cadence, comment-ID interval, SmartBeacon profile, and
  APRS path defaults are retuned for coordinated deployments where 15–20 trackers share a channel during an
  event window — search and rescue, ultra-marathon timing, jetboat racing, and similar.

- **Configuration ergonomics for field deployment.** USB serial setup CLI for scripted/tethered
  configuration, persistent digipeater state across reboots, and a short boot-time AP window that makes the
  web UI reachable without relying on display. Initial provisioning of a fresh device still routes through
  the web UI.

> Network compatibility note: every device on a LoRa APRS network must run identical SF/BW/CR. If you flash
> this fork onto a tracker that needs to talk to a fleet running stock CA2RXU defaults, you must either
> change the receivers or change this tracker's settings to match.
